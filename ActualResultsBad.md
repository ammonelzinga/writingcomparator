    ure! Here's a friendly summary of the results: --- Hey there! ðŸŒŸ Here are some interesting insights from the scriptures: 1. **Recognizing True vs. False Messengers**: If you meet a genuine messenger from God and ask to shake hands, they wonâ€™t move because they canâ€™t deceive. In contrast, an angel of light might offer a handshake but you won't feel anything. This is a great way to tell the difference! (D&C 129) 2. **Key Insights from Joseph Smith**: In a teaching from April 1843, Joseph Smith shared some important truths. He explained that when the Savior returns, He'll appear as a man, and that the social connections we have in this life will continue in a glorious form in the next. He also emphasized that blessings come from following divine laws. (D&C 130) 3. **The Nature of God**: It's revealed that both God the Father and Jesus Christ have bodies of flesh and bones, while the Holy Ghost is a spirit. This is a fundamental understanding that helps clarify their unique natures. (D&C 130) Overall, these teachings emphasize the importance of discernment in spiritual matters, the nature of divine beings, and the joy of eternal connections. Hope you find this as uplifting and thought-provoking as I do! ðŸ˜Š
